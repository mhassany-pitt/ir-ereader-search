# ir-ereader-search

this is a simple prototype demonstrating search functionality in ereader.

ereader is a simple web application that is used in the courses, enabling the students to read their assigned weekly readings. since we don't have access to the ereader codebase, we created a minimal prototype to demonstrate the search functionality.

in this prototype, we have used [typesense](https://typesense.org/) as the search engine, [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) for the backend and [angular](https://angular.io/) for the ui. 

check [ereader](./ereader/README.md), and [ereader-ui](./ereader-ui/README.md) for details.
